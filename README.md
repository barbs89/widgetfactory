## **BRIEF**

### Problem/Solution overview:

- Retailers have their own websites (e.g. a WordPress site)
- They want to embed their products from the marketplace.
- They want the integration to be set-and-forget:
  - Set up connection & configuration
  - Integrate Javascript snippet into site
  - Forget about it
- The look and feel of the embedded widget should be configurable
- The widget platform can be externally hosted (outside of the companies AWS environment - e.g. on Heroku)

### Architecture overview:

1. Widget Front-End is embedded to Customers Website
2. Links to the marketplace
3. Processes data from the companies client API
4. Fetches and updates products from the Widget Back-End

### System overview:

1. Retailer retrieves API from the companies platform
2. Enters the API key into Widget Platform
3. The company retrieves products for the Widget Platform
4. Widget rendered in the Widget platform and embedded in the Customer's site
5. Customer's site links back to main site for details/checkout

### Configuration options:

- Enter API key
- Enter which products to show (search parameters)
- How many?
- What format/details to show?
- Branding/colours
- Show on Marketplace or Storefront
